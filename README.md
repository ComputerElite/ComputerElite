### Hi there
So how do I get started? Oh I got it:
### programing
#### Scratch
Can you really call this programing? I mean I made a bad minecraft clone xD.
#### Batch
I started with "real" programing in Batch (ik bad language). I have programed a working Chat with it while I followed a YouTube video. After that was finished I started adding more an more features until I started:
#### HTML & CSS
After I used Batch (I still use it today). I tried myself in HTML and CSS. I understand how it works and gave me some Ideas. But I'm not the creative person and I didn't like HTML that much (maybe I'd love it if I learned it more). I got bored and started with:
#### Java
I thought since when I started programing I always heard of Java but I thought it was to complicated. But it was already 2 Years since I started programing. I started Java mainly because I started playing minecraft Java edition and wanted to code a plugin. After I did my plugin I strted with console applications and started programing [QSE](https://github.com/ComputerElite/QSE):
#### C#
Here I am. I ported [QSE](https://github.com/ComputerElite/QSE) to C# because a friend said I could build a GUI. I made the GUI and ported the code in about 3 hours. At first I developed new features in C# and Java but I quickly realized that it was to much work. That's why I discontinued the Java Version. I started Loving C# that much that I now only code in C# And want to make a GUI for everything:
#### Problems?
I have my basic Code I use for almost every project (Buttons, Layout, Update Code). But It takes about half an hour to an hour to get the GUI to look nice and set up everything for a new program. So I sometimes hate it.
### What am I doing right now?
N/A
